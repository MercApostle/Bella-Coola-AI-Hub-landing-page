# Project: Bella Coola AI Hub — The 7 Laws of Success
# Status: FINAL / LOCKED
# Build Type: Single-page diagnostic landing page
# Owner: Human (manual review, manual PDF creation, manual email delivery)

---

## 1. PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

Build a calm, authoritative, single-page diagnostic system that:

- allows self-reflection without submission
- optionally captures email + answers
- enables manual review by the owner
- results in a **customized PDF + AI prompt pack**
- PDF is designed to work with **any LLM or future AI system**
- PDF is manually created and emailed within **24–48 hours**
- uses **free, powerful tools only**
- introduces AI as leverage, not dependency

This is NOT:
- a course
- an educational explainer
- a funnel
- an affiliate page
- an automated AI system

---

## 2. NON-NEGOTIABLE CONSTRAINTS

DO NOT:
- add accounts or authentication
- add CTAs in the hero section
- create law "cards"
- explain or teach the laws
- integrate paid APIs or LLM calls
- automate PDF generation
- add urgency, hype, popups, or funnels
- add affiliate sections to the landing page

DO:
- require email ONLY if submitting
- keep all questions optional
- implement each law as its own full-width section (cell)
- keep user on page after submit
- store submissions for manual processing
- emphasize calm, autonomy, clarity

## 4. HERO SECTION (NO CTA)

### Animation
- Display the word "STOP."
- Style: very large, bold, red
- Behavior:
  - appears immediately on load
  - grows in 2–3 pulses
  - fades out completely
- Remaining hero text stays visible and calm

### Hero Copy (EXACT — DO NOT EDIT)

STOP.  
Take your time with this.

What follows is designed to give you back freedom of time, clarity of focus, and space for what actually matters—by aligning how you work with the underlying mechanics that produce results.

Mastering these laws means mastering your time.

Most people work harder to get ahead.  
Aligned systems reduce effort, increase leverage, and win over time.

### Rules
- No buttons
- No links
- No prompts
- Natural scroll only

---

## 5. ALIGNMENT STATEMENT (STANDALONE)

### Placement
Immediately after the Hero section, before "What You'll Receive".

### Copy (EXACT)

Nothing is broken. It's simply out of alignment.  
And alignment can always be restored.

### Presentation Rules
- No buttons
- No links
- No animation
- Smaller than hero text
- Generous whitespace
- Calm typography

---

## 6. WHAT YOU'LL RECEIVE (PDF + LLM COMPATIBILITY)

### Copy (LOCKED)

The customized PDF you receive is designed to work with **any large language model** and **emerging AI systems**—now and in the future.

It is not tied to a specific tool or platform.

Using the information you provide, the owner translates your situation into a **clear, structured document** you can use with:
- current LLMs
- future AI tools
- or any system that helps you think, plan, and execute more effectively

The purpose of the PDF is to help you create **real, useful outcomes**—for yourself and for your company—without added complexity or cost.

This is about leverage, not dependency.  
Clarity, not automation for its own sake.

### Microcopy
- Works with free and paid AI tools
- No platform lock-in
- Designed to stay useful as tools evolve

---

## 7. HOW TO USE THIS (TUTORIAL)

### Copy (LOCKED)

Answer these questions for yourself first.

They are designed to help you align what you're doing in business—or in life—with how you actually think, decide, and operate.

If you want the owner to review your answers and send you a **customized PDF + prompt pack**, you'll need to include your email when you submit.

If not, that's completely fine.  
You can simply use the questions as a personal alignment check.

There's no account.  
No obligation.  
No pressure.

### Microcopy
- Email required only if submitting
- All questions optional
- More detail = better customization

---

## 10. LAW CONTENT (DO NOT ALTER)

### LAW 2 — CORRESPONDENCE
Hook: Internal order shows up externally.  
Description: Culture, operations, and leadership habits always express as outcomes.  
Questions:
1. What problem do you keep tolerating that you know you shouldn't?
2. Where does work slow down most (handoffs, unclear ownership, communication, conflict)?
3. If your business was fully aligned, what would customers notice first?
Submit label: Save my Correspondence answers

### LAW 5 — RHYTHM
Hook: Success moves in cycles.  
Description: Growth and recovery are both required. Ignoring cycles causes burnout and instability.  
Questions:
1. What season are you in right now: build, stabilize, scale, repair, or reset?
2. What feels most overextended (cashflow, delivery, team capacity, leadership attention)?
3. What would you stop for 30 days to regain control?
Submit label: Save my Rhythm answers

### LAW 6 — CAUSE & EFFECT
Hook: Results are delayed decisions.  
Description: Outcomes are feedback. Ownership accelerates learning and improvement.  
Questions:
1. What outcome are you getting that you don't want?
2. What do you believe is the root cause (best guess)?
3. What's one small change you could make this week that would shift the result?
Submit label: Save my Cause & Effect answers

### LAW 7 — GENDER
Hook: Creation requires complementary forces.  
Description: Vision and execution must work together or the business stalls.  
Questions:
1. What valuable idea is stuck and not implemented?
2. What keeps it stuck (no owner, unclear next step, time, fear, no system)?
3. If you could delegate 80%, what would you keep vs hand off?
Submit label: Save my Gender answers
