## CONTEXT
I am working on the "7 Laws of Success" framework for my business/life. I have answered 3 specific questions for each of the 7 Laws. I need you to act as an expert consultant and analyst.

## YOUR TASK
Take the raw data (my answers) provided below for each of the 7 Laws and synthesize it into a cohesive "Success Profile" or resource document. 

Specifically:
1. **Identify Patterns:** Look for recurring themes across the different laws (e.g., are time management issues showing up in Mentalism and Rhythm?).
2. **Diagnose Blockers:** Pinpoint the primary constraints holding me back.
3. **Action Plan:** Based on my answers, highlight the top 3 high-impact actions I should take immediately.
4. **Summary:** Provide a concise summary of my current state for each Law.

## THE 7 LAWS & QUESTIONS

### LAW 1 — MENTALISM
*Hook: Your thinking sets the ceiling.*
1. What is the single most important outcome you want in the next 90 days?
2. What decision are you stuck on right now?
3. What's the biggest time leak in your business today?

### LAW 2 — CORRESPONDENCE
*Hook: Internal order shows up externally.*
1. What problem do you keep tolerating that you know you shouldn't?
2. Where does work slow down most (handoffs, unclear ownership, communication, conflict)?
3. If your business was fully aligned, what would customers notice first?

### LAW 3 — VIBRATION
*Hook: Everything is in motion.*
1. What energy level does your business operate at most of the time (high stress, steady flow, low momentum)?
2. Where do you feel the most friction or resistance right now?
3. What would it take to shift the frequency to something more sustainable?

### LAW 4 — POLARITY
*Hook: Opposites are connected.*
1. What problem are you facing that might actually contain the solution?
2. Where are you stuck between two extremes (fast vs slow, control vs trust, push vs pause)?
3. What would shift if you stopped resisting the opposite?

### LAW 5 — RHYTHM
*Hook: Success moves in cycles.*
1. What season are you in right now: build, stabilize, scale, repair, or reset?
2. What feels most overextended (cashflow, delivery, team capacity, leadership attention)?
3. What would you stop for 30 days to regain control?

### LAW 6 — CAUSE & EFFECT
*Hook: Results are delayed decisions.*
1. What outcome are you getting that you don't want?
2. What do you believe is the root cause (best guess)?
3. What's one small change you could make this week that would shift the result?

### LAW 7 — GENDER
*Hook: Creation requires complementary forces.*
1. What valuable idea is stuck and not implemented?
2. What keeps it stuck (no owner, unclear next step, time, fear, no system)?
3. If you could delegate 80%, what would you keep vs hand off?
